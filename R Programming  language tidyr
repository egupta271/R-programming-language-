tidyr is a package in R that is part of the tidyverse collection. 
It is designed to help you tidy and reshape your data. 
The primary functions in tidyr are gather() and spread(), which are used for converting data between wide and long formats. 
Here are some basic examples of using tidyr:

Example 1: Reshaping Data with gather()
# Load tidyr
library(tidyr)

# Create a sample data frame
data_long <- data.frame(
  ID = c(1, 2, 3),
  Day1 = c(10, 15, 20),
  Day2 = c(12, 18, 22),
  Day3 = c(14, 20, 25)
)

# Original Data
print("Original Data:")
print(data_long)

# Reshape data from wide to long
data_long <- gather(data_long, key = "Day", value = "Value", -ID)

# Tidied Data
print("Tidied Data:")
print(data_long)

Example 2: Reshaping Data with spread()
# Create a sample data frame
data_wide <- data.frame(
  ID = c(1, 2, 3),
  Day1 = c(10, 15, 20),
  Day2 = c(12, 18, 22),
  Day3 = c(14, 20, 25)
)

# Original Data
print("Original Data:")
print(data_wide)

# Reshape data from long to wide
data_wide <- spread(data_wide, key = "Day", value = "Value")

# Tidied Data
print("Tidied Data:")
print(data_wide)
