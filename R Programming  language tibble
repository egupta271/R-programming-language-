A tibble is a modern data frame in R that is part of the tidyverse. 
Tibbles are a modern alternative to the traditional R data frame, and they come with several advantages. Tibbles are created and used by the tibble package.

Here are some key features and examples of using tibble:

Example 1: Creating a Tibble
# Load the tibble package
library(tibble)

# Create a tibble
my_tibble <- tibble(
  Name = c("Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"),
  Age = c(25, 30, 22),
  Salary = c(50000, 60000, 45000)
)

# Print the tibble
print(my_tibble)

Example 2: Printing Tibble Information
# Print information about the tibble
glimpse(my_tibble)
The glimpse() function provides a concise summary of the structure of the tibble, including the data types and the first few observations.

Example 3: Subsetting Columns
# Select specific columns from the tibble
selected_columns <- my_tibble %>% select(Name, Salary)

# Print the result
print(selected_columns)

Example 4: Filtering Rows
# Filter rows based on a condition
filtered_rows <- my_tibble %>% filter(Age > 25)

# Print the result
print(filtered_rows)

Example 5: Mutating Columns
# Add a new column to the tibble
mutated_tibble <- my_tibble %>% mutate(Bonus = 0.1 * Salary)

# Print the result
print(mutated_tibble)

Example 6: Arranging Rows
# Arrange rows based on a column
arranged_tibble <- my_tibble %>% arrange(desc(Salary))

# Print the result
print(arranged_tibble)

Example 7: Summarizing Data
# Summarize data in the tibble
summary_stats <- my_tibble %>% summarize(AvgSalary = mean(Salary))

# Print the result
print(summary_stats)
